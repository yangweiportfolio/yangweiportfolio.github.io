						<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
						Ever since I was little, I was interested in how parts functioned and how they can interconnect with others
						to form a larger moving piece. My grandfather played a large role of influencing my interest and encouraging
						me to study mechanical engineering. Now, I have successfully received my Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. I study mechanical engineer with the goal of
						participating or leading in projects that will potentially impact the world currently or futuristically. As a
						mechanical engineer, I aspire to build personal character, discover my own engineering path, and building a
						mastery of my craft.</p>
					<p> I am currently a middle- high school Lead tutor at PROJECT: VISION, a non-profit 
organization located in my community, focusing on low-income family students. As a 
successful tutor, I was able to improve my time management skills, as well as develop 
strong communication skills. Moreover, I’ve also held a previous internship in Exelon, 
managing and working on multiple future project plans on improving data storage, 
switching to more environmentally friendly energy, and analyzing the risks and costs 
of each project. In addition, I have also participated in a research opportunity, as an 
assistant, in Additive Manufacturing Processes where I was tasked with performing 
analysis on metallic specimens by analyzing the sizes and the number of porosities 
formed on the specimen, in a microscope, after the process of sintering, taking 
pictures, and plotting the analyzed data. To add on, I was the leader of the Energy 
Efficiency team in IIT’s Electrical Energy and Efficiency senior design project where 
we designed and researched energy efficient sources to improve the energy methods 
of a dormitory. This resulted in us being able to obtain third place in the video 
				competition and fifth on the design proposal. </p>
