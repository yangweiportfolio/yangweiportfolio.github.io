									<p>During the fall semester of 2018 in my Introduction to Mechanical Engineering 
course, our team, of four, was tasked with the objective of building an instrument that 
can successfully be tuned and can be used to play a song. Our team decided to build 
an instrument that was similar to a guitar, The body was designed to be a rectangular 
prism with two large curve cuts on the surface. The neck of the instrument was 
designed to have the same length as a standard acoustic guitar and each fret was 
positioned similar to those found on an acoustic guitar. The position of each fret, on 
the neck, was researched and measured and was stabilized by cutting slits on the neck 
and placing the frets within. Four turning keys were placed on the end of the neck and 
four strings was attached to a key that reached across the whole instrument. </p>

									<p>Result: The instrument was able to play tunes similar to an acoustic guitar but at a 
lower pitch since there is no opening in the middle of the body but instead there were
openings on the sides. Also, less pitches can be played since there as only four tuning 
keys compared to the six that an acoustic guitar has.</p>
