									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>For the spring semester of 2022, my team was tasked with the objective to brainstorm a need and to then plan, design, develop, and prototype a solution for the desired need. The chosen need was the process for making high quality ice cubes, for cocktails, requires too many hands steps and would need a more efficient method. To combat this need, the final product was designed and prototyped based on five fundamental requirements that our team create. These functional requirements are: production, clarity, rmovability, dimension, and cost.
									<li> Quality: the clear ice cube machiine must be able to produce at least one 2.25 inch clear ice cube
									<li> Clarity: the ice cubes must be at least 80% transparent (no sediment or cloudy formations, small amounts of air bubbles
									<li> Removability: Ice cubes can be easily removed from ice tray after 24 hours or more freezing time
									<li> Dimensions: The ice cube machine must be able to fit within 512 cubic inches of space
										<li> Cost: The cost of building the ice cube machine must be exceed $150 </p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p> After repetitive experiments and design changes, our team was able to develop an prototype a device that successfully met all the functional requirements and utilizing the method of directional freezing, to produce four 2.25 inch high quality, clear ice cubes without the conventional hand steps required. Each of the ice cube produced had high clarity, no cloudiness or sediments formed, easily to store within a residential or commercial freezer, and can be easily removed from the machine. </p>
