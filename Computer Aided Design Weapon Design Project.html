									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>During the spring semester of 2022 in my Computer Graphics in Engineering course, for our final assignment project, my partner and I was tasked with the objective of designing and creating drawings of an object, of our choice, using one of the computer-aided design (CAD) programs that we learned during the semester. The design criteria of the object are:
									<li> Must be modeled using either AutoCAD, Inventor or Revit
									<li> The hard copy of the drawings must be on B size (11’’ x 17’’) paper with title block and heading
									<li> The design model can be a replication of a part or an object, a recreation of something that was designed in the past, or can be completely new </p>
									
									<p> With the following design criteria, my partner and I decided on creating a replication of a weapon from a video game that we both enjoy. The CAD program that was used to design this weapon was Autodesk Inventor, and the weapon that is being replicated is named the “Prime 2.0 Karambit” knife from the popular video game called “Valorant”.  </p>
									<p> The knife consists of five different parts that we named: “KnifeBlade”, “Body”, “Hinge1”, “Hinge2”, and “Screw”. The “KnifeBlade” is the curved blade of the knife with a length of 3.97 inches. The “Body” is the body of the knife which consists of the handle and the finger ring with a total body length of 7.24 inches. “Hinge1” and “Hinge2” are the pieces used for the folding mechanism. These two hinge pieces would allow the blade to be folded into the body and the screws will attach the hinges to the blade and the body. </p>
									<p> Each part was drawn and the whole knife was assembled using Autodesk Inventor. Each part on the assembly drawing was ballooned and a bill of materials was created that correlates to each part. </p>
