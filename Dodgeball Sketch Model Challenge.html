									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>During the spring semester of 2022 in my Design if Mechanical Systems, my team was tasked with the objective of designing and building a device that would be capable of being pushed or pulled by a driver while the rider would be throwing dodgeballs without touching the floor. The functional requirements that our team decided were:
									<li> Design must be under 25 lbs
									<li> Design must keep the rider safe from being hit with dodgeballs 
									<li> The design must be easy for the driver to maneuver 
									<li> Design must comfortably hold a rider that is at least 5’11”
									<li> Rider must be able to properly throw a dodgeball at least 10 ft
									<li> Must be created under $100 dollars </p>
										
									<p> With these functional requirements, the base of the design was developed using two layers of foam core boards aligned perpendicular to each other and would then be laminated with cardboard. Three vertically cut PVC tubes, with one end cut at a 15-degree angle, was placed onto the bottom of base to act as sleds. The body was made with cardboard and was shaped as a pentagon to provide the rider with as much protection from dodgeballs as possible. Rectangular slits were cut on the body of the device in order to provide the rider with more visuals on their surroundings. The interior of the device consists of three cylindrical paper tubes acting as support for the foldable joints of the cardboard as well as handles to create more stability for the rider. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>Results: Our team successfully created a sled device that was able to freely move in the snow. Our device was able to meet all of the functional requirements, win the final round of the dodgeball competition, and win second place in a speed competition.</p>
