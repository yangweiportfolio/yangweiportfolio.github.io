									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>During the spring semester of 2020 in my Design for Innovation course, our 
professor tasked my team, of four, with the objective of being able to design a chair 
that holds the following design requirements:
<li> Must be able to withhold an 80kg person
<li> Seat Height must be between 480mm and 530mm
<li> Seat depth and width must be between 360mm and 420mm
<li> Must be made of entirely foam core board and no fasteners must be used. </p>
<p>The seat idea that I developed was using a circular base in order to have an even 
disperse of force and would be easier to manufacture. Each leg would be a thin 
rectangular piece with two rectangular pegs that will interlock with the other legs and 
	the circular base in order to create stability.</p>
<p>A Von Mises Stress analysis was done using Autodesk Inventor and it can be seen 
that this design has low chances of distorting or failing under pressure when 180 lbs 
of force has been placed on to the circular surface of the seat.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p> Our team was able to successfully cut out the chair seat and legs, using a 
laser cutter, and construct a chair that fits in all of the design requirements. </p>
